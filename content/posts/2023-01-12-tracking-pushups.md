In November of 2022, I joined two of my friends in competing in a group challenge to see whether or not we could complete 100 push-ups every day for November. The rules were very simple. You need to hit 100 push-ups; it doesn't matter how you do it, you have to do it. There was no penalty for failing; you just needed to accept that you failed. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Up until two years ago, I couldn't do a single push-up. I weighed too much and wasn't strong enough. To say that I was going into this challenge confident would be an understatement, it had been 12 months since I'd done a push-up. In preparation for the event, I did a simple set of 10, with the results being less than impressive. I watched several videos on YouTube, trying to understand the correct technique better, and stumbled across a  video outlining the negatives of challenging yourself to do 100 push-ups a day. The video cited injuries and poor as the primary detractors when participating in this type of challenge. I wasn't to be deterred and forged forward with my belief that I'd tap out sometime towards the end of the first week.

What I didn't realise is that this type of challenge has the proper ingredients to build and sustain positive change:
- It was time-bound, short enough to grind through it, all the while knowing an end date.
- I was accountable to others; I didn't want to disappoint them.
- It was competitive; I didn't want to lose.
- It made me feel a sense of accomplishment; I had to do something a bit tough, and each time I succeeded, I received a juicy squeeze of dopamine.
- It has a physical outcome; after doing 3,000 push-ups, you certainly feel a difference.

I noticed my behaviours and the positive impact carrying over into my life:
- I needed to work around commitments out of my control. It forced me to get up early and get them done before leaving the house.
- It encouraged me to include the children and set an excellent example for them; they wanted to participate and became my cheerleader.
- I wanted to seek more 30-day challenges
- I wanted to build more habits

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Since completing (and winning the challenge), I have continued this habit, missing only five days in December (I even did them on Christmas and Boxing Day). I'm prioritising more strength training in January. I don't want to overtrain, so I have dropped my commitment to 50 in January but continue to feel positive. Although I may not continue this deeper into the year, this simple habit has been the genesis for focussing on incrementally building my pool of daily routines.
