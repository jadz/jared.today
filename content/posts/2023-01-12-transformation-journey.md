Recently on the [Bren and Jared Show](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1985994/12029208) we discussed new years resolutions and why I believe they're no longer relevant. In short, I believe in needing to think about what things you want to change in your life but leaving it until January 1st shouldn't be when you think about it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Instead, I am trying to build on my own identity. Although this is a work in progress, as I grow more into this way of thinking, I am making minor adjustments to my daily behaviours to match who I am. This is a more sustainable and optimal way of living. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Identity, according to Wikipedia, is the qualities, beliefs, personal traits, appearance, and or/expressions that characterise a person. This apt description is a great tool to anchor decisions about the various aspects of life and one that I will continue to use.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I still have a long way to go in defining my identity, but I can confidently say that I no longer identify as the "party guy". I was the guy that needed to get everybody drunk and stay till the very end because doing made me happy. That part of my life is over. Now I identify as a health-conscious husband and father, focused on creating the healthiest and strongest version of myself. Unlocking my true abilities as a responsible father who wants his children to grow up able to be their strongest and most confident selves.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

With this new narrative forming part of my identity, I can now define how I see that manifesting itself. This is where I am focussed on setting a macro-level target with micro-level steps. Make sure to distinguish micro-level from detailed and rigid; it's different. In this context, the micro-level should be seen as habit and behaviour changes aligned with a plan. Therefore, my immediate focus is identifying long-term health and well-being goals by changing my habits and behaviours.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Goal 1**: By September 1st, 2023, I will be 90kg and 13% body fat. Why? Not only will this challenge my mental game, but it will have meant I will have achieved a desire that I have been chasing for decades. This isn't an arbitrary number as 13%:

-   It is not associated with a 'dad bod'.
-   It is uncommon in my current age group.
-   It is maintainable in older age.
-   It significantly reduces health risks.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Goal 2:** By June 15th, 2024, I want to safely achieve optimal compound lift numbers and general body strength goals ([inspiration here](https://whitecoattrainer.com/blog/how-strong-are-you)) whilst maintaining a healthy body fat percentage. Reaching an optimal level of strength will have immense health and longevity benefits. I'm not interested in becoming a power-lifter, I'm interested in having a high level of functional strength.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I have had to mentally jostle with wanting to achieve both goals simultaneously. In the past, this has been one of my major downfalls. It's essential that I only focus on one thing, trust in my system and focus only on maintaining muscle and dropping body fat.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I am confident that I will get gradually stronger over the next 12 months, but I am content with not seeing the strength gains that will help me achieve my second goal. For that, I'll need a different training plan.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Here are the plans and systems that support my goals:
- I have a phased strength training plan marked out on a calendar.
- I have a phased cut, maintenance and a bulk plan marked out on a calendar. This is aligned with the training phases.
- I prioritise sleep and recovery by going to bed between 21:00 - 22:00. 
- I have introduced more low-intensity cardio by walking and aiming for 10,000 steps.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Open-sourcing (publicly sharing) these goals and measuring my progress is my way of being held accountable. For those that choose to follow my journey, it's a way of setting myself up for success.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I am excited to see how I handle the inevitable loss of enthusiasm and willpower. Because for the next 32 weeks, it will be hard work and dedication. I'll need to trust my system and focus on the journey rather than the goal. Because I know that when the end comes, I may not be happy and want more. It's all about the here and now and enjoying every day.
